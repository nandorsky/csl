            Each slide is composed by <img> and .info
            - .info's position is customized with css in index.css
            - each <img> parallax effect is declared by the following params inside its class:
            
            example: class="asset left-472 sp600 t120 z3"
            left-472 means left: -472px from the center
            sp600 is speed transition
            t120 is top to 120px
            z3 is z-index to 3
            Note: Maintain this order of params

            For the backgrounds, you can combine from the bgs folder :D
